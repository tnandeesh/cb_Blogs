        <p>An IAM is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group typical administrator permissions. Any user in that user group automatically has Admins group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the Admins user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions you can remove them from the old user groups and add them to the appropriate new user groups.</p>

        <h3>To create an IAM user group and attach policies</h3>
        <ol>
                <p>1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" title="Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/</a></p>
                <p>2. In the navigation pane, choose User groups and then choose Create group.</p>
                <p>3. For User group name, type the name of the group.</p>
                <p>4. In the list of users, select the check box for each user that you want to add to the group.</p>
                <p>5. In the list of policies, select the check box for each policy that you want to apply to all members of the group.</p>
                <p>6. Choose Create group.</p>
        </ol>

            <h3>Characteristics of IAM Group</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A group is a collection of users, and a user can also belong to multiple groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups cannot be nested, i.e., a group cannot contain another group.</li>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>No default group that automatically includes all the users in AWS account. If you want a group like this, create a group and then add the users in a group.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a limit to the number of groups that you can have and also have a limit to the number of groups that a user can belong to.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits of Using IAM User Groups</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplified Management: IAM User Groups streamline permission management by allowing you to apply policies to a group of users rather than individual users.</li>
            <li>Consistent Permissions: Users within the same group automatically inherit the permissions assigned to the group, ensuring consistency.</li>
            <li>Ease of Scaling: As your organization grows, it's easier to scale permissions by adding users to relevant groups with predefined access levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Best Practices for IAM User Groups</h3>
        <p>When working with IAM User Groups, consider the following best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Naming Conventions: Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for your groups to easily identify their purpose.</li>
            <li>Least Privilege Principle: Apply the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to each group.</li>
            <li>Regular Audits: Periodically review and audit group memberships and permissions to ensure they align with your organization's requirements.</li>
        </ul>
