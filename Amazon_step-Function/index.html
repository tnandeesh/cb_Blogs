    <h2>Step Functions</h2>

    <p>As your applications execute, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Step Functions</a> maintains application state, tracking exactly which workflow step your application is in, and stores an event log of data that is passed between application components. That means that if networks fail or components hang, your application can pick up right where it left off.</p>

    <p>Application development is faster and more intuitive with Step Functions because you can define and manage the workflow of your application independently from its business logic. Making changes to one does not affect the other. You can easily update and modify workflows in one place, without having to struggle with managing, monitoring, and maintaining multiple point-to-point integrations. You can also easily integrate with virtually any SaaS application directly from your workflows.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of Step Functions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick Onboarding:</strong> Start building quickly with Workflow Studio, a simple drag-and-drop interface for expressing complex business logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Automation:</strong> Automate workflows across over 220 AWS services without maintaining code.</li>
        <li><strong>Event-driven architecture visualization:</strong> Visualize and develop resilient workflows for event-driven architectures.</li>
        <li><strong>Process data on demand:</strong> Use code to process data on demand with large-scale parallel workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How it works</h3>

    <h3>Use Cases for AWS Step Functions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Step Functions is useful for any engineering teams who need to build workflows across multiple Amazon services. Use cases for Step Functions vary widely, from orchestrating serverless microservices, to building data-processing pipelines, to defining a security-incident response. As mentioned above, Step Functions may be used for synchronous and asynchronous business processes. The following example shows an asynchronous Step Functions workflow for approving a credit-line increase. The workflow includes Amazon SNS components and several Lambda functions:</li>

    <h3>AWS Step Functions Standard Workflows pricing details:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You are charged based on the number of state transitions required to execute your application.</li>
        <li>Step Functions counts a state transition each time a step of your workflow is executed. You are charged for the total number of state transitions across all your state machines, including retries.</li>
        <li>The Step Functions free tier includes 4,000 free state transitions per month. All charges are metered daily and billed monthly.</li>
