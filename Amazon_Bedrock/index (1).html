        <h2>Amazon Bedrock Overview</h2>
        <p>Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerate development of generative AI applications using FMs through an API, without managing infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Choose FMs from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon to find the right FM for your use case.</li>
            <li>Use AWS tools and capabilities that you are familiar with to deploy scalable, reliable, and secure generative AI applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Get Started with Key Use Cases Quickly</h2>

            <li><p>Apps built with Amazon Bedrock can generate original written text in various forms, such as short stories, blog posts, news articles and social media posts.</p></li>
           
            <h2>Chatbots</h2>
            <img> src="chatbots.png" alt="chatbots.png" width="100" height="90"
            <li><p>Build conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants to enhance the user experience for your customers.</p></li>

            <h2>Search</h2>
            <img> src="Search.png" alt="Search.png" width="100" height="90"
            <li><p>Search, find, and synthesize information to answer questions from a large corpus of data.</p></li>
    
            <h2>Text summarization</h2>
            <img> src="TextSummarization.png" alt="TextSummarization.png" width="100" height="90"
            <li><p>A simple Bedrock app offers the capability to summarize text without forcing a user to pore over lengthy documents or materials.</p></li>
    
            <h2>Image generation</h2>
            <img> src="ImageGeneration.png" alt="ImageGeneration.png" width="100" height="90"
            <li><p>Bedrock's API can interface with various types of foundation models, including those with text-to-speech AI capabilities. Given that, an app built on Bedrock can take a request or prompt for a specific image from a user and generate that image.</p></li>

            <h2>Personalization</h2>
            <img> src="Personalization.png" alt="Personalization.png" width="100" height="90"
            <li><p>Help customers find what they're looking for with more relevant and contextual product recommendations than word matching.</p></li>
        
        <div> class="container">
            <h2> Choose from leading FMs</h2>
            <img> src="Choose-from-leading-FMs.png" alt="Choose-from-leading-FMs.png" width="650" height="450"
           <li><p>Amazon Bedrock makes building with a range of FMs as easy as an API call. Amazon Bedrock provides access to leading models including AI21 Labs' Jurassic, Anthropic's Claude, Cohere's Command and Embed, Meta's Llama 2, and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion, as well as our own Amazon Titan models. With Amazon Bedrock, you can select the FM that is best suited for your use case and application requirements.</p></li>
